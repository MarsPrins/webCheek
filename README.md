# An old forgotten project (should probably ignore)
---

I had the idea to sell websites online a long time ago, i made a full design and everything but then i thought it would be better to continue learning instead of
starting with selling now.

I'm happy i made that choice because now i'm experienced enough to where i'm confident enough that i can make anyone, anything in a matter of days.
